# Tailwind CSS Classes Ignored in Certain Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes are ignored within specific components due to incorrect configuration or scope. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## Problem

In some cases, Tailwind classes might not render any styles. This often happens because of missing or incorrect configuration of Tailwind within a specific component or a conflict in class naming or CSS specificity.

## Solution

Ensure that the Tailwind directives are properly applied to the component or element where you're using the classes. Consider CSS specificity and potential naming conflicts with your own custom styles.
