In the problematic component, ensure that Tailwind directives are correctly included and applied.

Incorrect Example (bug.js):
```javascript
// Incorrect usage - component missing Tailwind setup
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">
      {/* Tailwind class ignored because the component doesn't have it set up properly */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Corrected Example (bugSolution.js):
```javascript
// Correct usage - component with proper Tailwind directives
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">
      {/* Tailwind class applied correctly */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
Make sure to check your Tailwind configuration file (tailwind.config.js) and the paths in `content` array. Verify that the component is correctly imported and rendered, and check for CSS specificity conflicts.
